###1. What are three objectives of an OS design?
    The three main objectives of operating system are:
    1.  Convenience: OS must be more easy to use.
    2.  Efficiency: OS must efficiently use the resources of the system.
    3.  Ability to evolve: OS must not interfere with the evolution of the system. It must support the 
		evolution of the system.
		
###2. What is the kernel of an OS?
    Kernel is program, which connects the applications to the hardware of the system. It is the fundamental 
    part of the operating system. It manages the input and output requests from other programs, manages the
    memory, processes and other important functions.
    
###3. What is multiprogramming?
    It is the running of two or more programs on a uniprocessor. It makes the system as if it is running multiple
    programs simultaneously. Since the process is faster than human responses, it looks like the system is 
    processing multiple programs simultaneously.
    
###4. What is a process?
    A process can be defined as the program in execution or an instance of a program.
    
###5. How is the execution context of a process used by the OS?
    Execution context of a process is a information generated by the OS and contains process's identifier, state, 
    program counter, memory pointers and other data which identifies the process. This data is different from the 
    data present in the program of the process.
    
###6. List and briefly explain five storage management responsibilities of a typical OS.
    OS has storage responsibilities of: 
######  Process isolation:
	      It isolates one process from another thereby avoiding interfering of one process from another's memory.
######  Automatic allocation and management:
        Memory to the programs must be allocated and managed automatically. This relieves the programmer a 
        lot of work of manual memory allocation. Automatic memory allocation is efficient because the OS can
        allocate memory as per the need of the program but not as per the greed of the programmer.
######  Support of modular programming: 
        The programmer must be able to write, modify and delete programs in modules dynamically.
######  Protection and access control: 
        The OS must give controlled access to the memory locations of different users. It must decide when 
        to give and not to give access to memory associated with another user.
######  Long-term storage: 
        The OS must be able to store the program and its data after the system is shut down.
        
###7.Explain the distinction between a real address and a virtual address.
    Pysical address refer to the hardware addresses of physical memory while virtual address refers to the 
    address of the virtual memory.
    
###8.Describe the round-robin scheduling technique.
    Round robin scheduling is the technique in which the processes are processed in a circular manner. The 
    CPU is allocated to processes  in a circular fashion. This algorithm queues the processes in a circle.
    
###9.Explain the difference between a monolithic kernel and a microkernel.
    In monolithic kernel, most of the OS functions, like scheduling, memory management etc, are performed 
    by a large kernel. It is considered as single process and all the elements in this kernel share a 
    common address space. Whereas micro kernel performs only few functions like basic scheduling, address 
    spaces etc. The other functions are performed by other processes called servers that run in user mode.
    
###10.What is multithreading?
    Multithreading is technique in which a process is divided into multiple units called threads that can 
    run concurrently. 
    
###11.List the key design issues for an SMP operating system.
    SMP refers to symmetric multi processing and its key design issues include 
	    1.Simultaneous concurrent processes or threads.
	    2.Scheduling.
	    3.Synchronization.
	    4.Memory management.
	    5.Reliability and fault tolerance.
